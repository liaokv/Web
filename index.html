<p>Hello! My name is Kevin Liao (pronounced Lee-Ow).</p>
<p>I'm an undergraduate at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, set to graduate in Spring 2016 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences and a minor in Professional Writing.</p>
<p>I have a penchant for teaching and can be found yelling at the students who have had the misfortune of being placed in my genetics discussion class. Additionally, I am a medical scribe (in training) for the ER department of the Shady Grove Medical Center located in Rockville, MD.</p>
<p>Eventually, I intend to enter medical school and become a medical doctor. However, if that doesn't work out, there's always professional homelessness. </p>
<p>This site was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and my tears.</p>
