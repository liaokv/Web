<p>Hello! My name is Kevin Liao (pronounced Lee-Ow)!</p>
<p>I'm a senior at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, set to graduate in Spring 2016 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences and a minor in Professional Writing.</p>
<p>I have a penchant for teaching and can be found yelling at the students who have the misfortune of being placed in my genetics discussion class. Additionally, I am a medical scribe (in training) for the ER department of the Shady Grove Medical Center located in Rockville, MD.</p>
<p>Eventaully, I intend to enter Medical School and become a medical doctor. However, if that doesn't work out, there's always professional homelessness.  </p>
<p>This site was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and my tears.</p>
